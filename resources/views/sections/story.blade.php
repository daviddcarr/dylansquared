During that time they mostly knew of each other but weren't yet close.

            <p>
                Being the only two students from Lamar attending UALR they kept in touch with one another. It wasn't until August of 2011 that it all changed:

                A couple weeks later the two agreed to hang out at <span class="dylan-selby">Dylan S</span>'s place, only <span class="dylan-carr">Dylan C</span> never left. The chemistry was immediate.

                The two lived together in Little Rock for over two years until <span class="dylan-selby">Dylan S</span> was offered a job in Dallas, Texas. Together they moved to the Lone Star state, where they still live today.

            <p>
                After six years together <span class="dylan-carr">Dylan C</span> decided it was time to make their relationship a little more permanent.
            </p>
            <p>
                The two had made plans to visit europe for a week and a half long vacation for <span class="dylan-selby">Dylan S</span>'s birthday. <span class="dylan-carr">Dylan C</span> knew immediately this was the perfect time and place to pop the question.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fast forward several months to May 2018, the two are boarding a plane for London, England. <span class="dylan-carr">Dylan C</span> is secretly (and nervously) carrying a ring in a small compartment in his backpack, hoping security doesn't spoil the surprise. Fortunately for him, they didn't.
            </p>
            <p>
                On May 28th, 2018, <span class="dylan-carr">Dylan C</span> brought <span class="dylan-selby">Dylan S</span> to a restaurant on the 32nd floor of The Shard in London (The glass tower pictured <span class="d-inline d-md-none">below</span><span class="d-none d-md-inline">to the right</span>).
            </p>
            <p>
                While admiring the view and attempting to take pictures <span class="dylan-selby">Dylan S</span> complained that he couldn't quite take a good one through the rain on the glass. Standing behind, <span class="dylan-carr">Dylan C</span> pulls out the ring and asks "How about taking a picture of this? ... Will you marry me?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Are you serious???"
